# Robotics Assignment 1
For this assignment the challenge was to create a robot that could be used in different search and rescue scenarios.

## Mode 1
For Mode 1 We had to create a fully manual robot that could be controlled through a GUI, to go through the building and find survivors and call them out.

## Mode 2
For Mode 2 we had to create a semi-automomous robot that would keep within the corridors by itself, however when it was met with a wall, it would revert to manual control
